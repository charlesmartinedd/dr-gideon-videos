Hello, I'm Dr. William Gideon, chief executive officer

00:03.240 --> 00:05.440
and lead consultant for the Right Path Educational

00:05.440 --> 00:07.160
Consulting Incorporated.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.640
Thank you for the opportunity to connect

00:08.640 --> 00:11.040
with Acts of Region 14 leaders.

00:11.040 --> 00:14.080
At the Right Path, we believe that artificial intelligence

00:14.080 --> 00:17.280
isn't the future of education, it's the present.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.800
And school leaders deserve the tools, training,

00:19.800 --> 00:22.480
and confidence to use AI effectively,

00:22.480 --> 00:24.760
ethically, and strategically.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.920
Cross-California administrators are juggling

00:26.920 --> 00:29.160
more than ever compliance reports,

00:29.160 --> 00:32.920
communication demands, student data and staffing challenges.

00:32.920 --> 00:36.680
What we've discovered is that AI can simplify all of that

00:36.680 --> 00:39.160
when it's introduced the right way.

00:39.160 --> 00:42.520
Our proposal is simple, partner with Acts of Region 14

00:42.520 --> 00:45.680
to launch an AI for educational leadership,

00:45.680 --> 00:49.520
professional learning series designed exclusively

00:49.520 --> 00:51.760
for K-12 administrators.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.880
This isn't a tech tutorial, it's leadership development

00:55.880 --> 01:00.720
for the next era of education.

01:00.720 --> 01:04.920
The four session series is structured around practical hands-on

01:04.920 --> 01:10.120
outcome session one, demystifying AI for school leaders.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.440
We break down what AI really is, explore ethical use,

01:13.440 --> 01:18.000
and identify how we can save hours each week in your workflow.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Session two, AI as your executive assistant,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.680
learn to automate routine communication, reports,

01:23.680 --> 01:26.800
and board updates with precision and tone

01:26.800 --> 01:28.480
that reflect your leadership style.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.440
Session three, data-driven decision-making with AI.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.560
Discover how AI tools can help visualize school trends

01:36.560 --> 01:41.080
and make data interpretation faster and more equitable.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.800
Session four, AI for career advancement

01:43.800 --> 01:46.320
because great leaders plan ahead

01:46.320 --> 01:50.200
will show how to use AI for resume enhancement, cover letters,

01:50.200 --> 01:53.640
and interview preparation for your next step in leadership.
